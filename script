A. What we'll be making
Before we can get to creating our app let's look at what we're creating.
We're creating an application that connects to the moviedb api that'll allow us to
search the database choose a movie and and ahow some simple information like the release date and the synapses.
Then if we want to search something new we just click this little search button up here and we're back to searching again.

Now, the first thing we have to do when creating our app in React is plan how we would break down our app into components. 
Let's go ahead and break this down into components.  Top to bottom

We got a little search button that could be it's own thing for like a header but since it's just one thing 
we'll keep it in the main app template.

Then we have a search input that shows movies when typed in. So that all by it self can be a component. 
Then we have these cards displaying the search results title and backgrounds could be a component in itself inside of that
and those could all in a component that holds the list.

Then when we click on one of the these cards the search and search-results go away 
and the movie details show up. So this would be a completely seperate component from the search.

Let's call that movie details.

Last but not least we have simple footer which is always a good time to create a component. 

So next up we're going to setup the project with the necessary styles and links then get to creating these components

B.Setup Project
Files: style.css, animations.css 
0. ng new movie-search
1. npm install materialize-css --save
2. add paths to styles in angular-cli.json
3. add font link in index.html,   <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">  
4. add custom styles from the course files

C.Creating the component structure
So now we're going to create the structure of what we'd like to see using components it's time to create.
